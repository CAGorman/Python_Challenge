# Python_Challenge
Module 3 Challenge

Here you will find:
- PyBank: main.py (script) & budget_analysis.txt (corresponding txt file with answer table)
- PyPoll: main.py (script)

Notes:
- PyBank:
    The script ran and created a txt file with the answers. However, there was an issue with formatting on Average Change & Greatest Increase did not populate correctly.
  
- PyPoll:
    There were a few bugs that left me unable to run the script and generate a txt file. One that I suspect is an issue with correctly coding for the winner. Another that I was stumped about was in the "summary" section- it said that the () were not closed. However, I formatted the same as I did with PyBank- so I was not sure what the issue was.
